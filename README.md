- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Denis.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in solving difficult problems to the best of my ability and learning what's new in the software engineering industry. Problem solving is a hobby of mine, because of  how it's applied daily in solving every day problems. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying software engineering with the hopes of becoming a senior full stack developer one day. All rounder as they say :) Jack of all trades master of all.
